      Starting off with a cleanser, we recommend Glossier's Milky Jelly Cleanser. A soft and non-stripping cleanser should always be considered for a morning cleanse. Traditional foaming cleansers are often made with harsh surfectants that strip the skin of its important essential oils. This leads to dehydrated skin with a damaged skin barrier, leaving the skin more susceptible to acne and aging. That's why the Milky Jelly Cleanser is our top pick for a daily, gentle cleanser that will leave your skin feeling soft, supple, and clean all in one.
      <br><br>
      After cleansing your skin, you definitely want to follow up with a serum of some sort. Serums are powerful and concentrated skincare products that work fast to help solve and remedy specific skin concerns. We recommend Glossier's Super Bounce for a daily, hydrating cleanser. Remember when we said it was important for you not to strip your skin? This potent serum will be able to help your skin remain healthily hydrated and happy while also soothing and repairing your skin's own natural barrier. It's definitely a must have.
      <br><br>
      Lastly, you want to finish with a moisturizer to seal in all the hydration that was delivered by Super Bounce. We recommend Glossier's Priming Moisturizer. Light and fluffy in texture, in helps moisturize and lock in hydration effectively without feeling heavy, sticky, or greasy. Additionally, another benefit of this moisturizer is that it helps prime and prep the skin for makeup. If you're going make-up free, this moisturizer simply helps minimize the look of texture in the skin. Appropriate for all skin types, from dry to oily, from sensitive to tough, it's a must have for everyone.
